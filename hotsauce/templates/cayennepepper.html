          <p>The cayenne pepper is also known as the Guinea spice, cow-horn pepper, red hot chili pepper, bird pepper and red pepper. It is in the same family as bell peppers, jalape√±os and paprika. It is named for the city of Cayenne, the capital of French Guiana. It is a hot chili pepper used to add flavor to many dishes. Most commonly, the peppers are dried and ground in order to make a powdered spice. The peppers are also used in their whole form or in a thin- vinegar-based sauce. On the Scoville scale, cayenne peppers rate between 30,000 and 50,000 Scoville units. Cayenne pepper is a key ingredient in many hot sauces, including Frank's RedHot.</p>
