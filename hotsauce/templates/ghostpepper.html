          <p>The ghost pepper is also known as the Bhut jolokia, ghost chili, red naga, ghost jolokia and naga jolokia. It is an interspecific hybrid chili pepper cultivated in India. It is a hybrid of Capsicum chinense and Capsicum frutescens. It is believed that the name of the pepper comes from the way the heat sneaks up on one who eats it. It usually takes about 30-45 seconds for the heat to kick in. Guinness World Records certified that the ghost pepper was the world's hottest chili pepper in 2007. However, it lost this title in 2011 to the infinity chili. The Carolina Reaper is the current hottest chili pepper.</p>

          <p>The highest recorded Scoville rating for a ghost pepper is 1,001,304 SHUs. For comparison, habanero peppers have SHU values between 100,000 and 350,000. Like other peppers, climate has a considerable effect on the heat of these peppers. When grown outside of their northern Indian climate, ghost peppers lose some of their pungency. The heat level ranges from 661,451 SHUs to over 1 million SHUs. Unlike most peppers, ghost peppers produce capsaicin (the chemical compound that we interpret as spiciness) in both the placenta around the seeds and throughout the fruit. Ghost peppers are used as a spice, as well as a remedy to summer heat. It is often used to heat up curries, pickles and chutneys. Another popular use of the pepper is with pork or dried fish. In parts of India, ghost peppers are used in a very different way. They smear the peppers on fences as a safety precaution to keep elephants at a distance.</p>
