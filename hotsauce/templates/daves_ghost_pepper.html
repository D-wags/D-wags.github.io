            Dave's Gourmet Ghost Pepper Jolokia Sauce is a relative newcomer on the scene compared to some of its more recognizable contemporaries but what this sauce lacks in experience it makes up for excruciating heat.  Made from the revered ghost pepper(Scoville unit > 1,000,000!) The sauce itself has a scoville rating in excess of 850,000. This sauce is generally sold in 5 oz bottles which is enough to outlast the average spice-head and the next several generations of his/her kin. Use one drop at a time and with extreme care as 1 drop equates to ~100 jalepenos.
            <br><br>
            Dave's Gourmet Ghost Pepper Jolokia Sauce is produced in Costa Rica and its ingredients include Ghost Pepper/Naga Jolokia hot chili peppers, hot pepper extract, salt, vegetable oil, roasted garlic pulp, and acetic acid.
            <br><br>
            The disclaimer from the bottle informs its users that the sauce is also a "great industrial cleaner and grease remover".
