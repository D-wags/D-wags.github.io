            Cholula is a flavorful and popular chili-based hot sauce, manufactured in Chapala, Jalisco, Mexico, and licensed by Jos√© Cuervo. According to its manufacturers, Cholula hot sauce rates 1,000 on the Scoville scale though other sources measure it as being over three times hotter, at 3,600 Scoville units. The product is packaged with an iconic round wooden top.
            <br><br>
            The hot sauce is named after the 2,500-year-old city of Cholula, Puebla, the oldest still-inhabited city in Mexico. The name "Cholula" is derived from the Nahuatl toponym Chollollan, meaning "the place of the retreat". Prior to its acquisition, Cholula was produced for three generations in Chapala, Jalisco, used primarily as an ingredient in the tequila based beverage sangrita. Following expansion across the Mexican market, Cholula was first introduced to the United States in the great city of Austin, Texas in 1989. During the 1990s, Cholula achieved distribution in supermarket chains throughout the American Southwest and is currently available nationwide, as well as in many Canadian supermarkets. The product is most frequently retailed in 5-ounce glass bottles, although the original flavor is also available in 2-ounce and 12-ounce glass bottles, as well as 64-ounce plastic bottle, and 7-gram single-use condiment packets.
            <br><br>
            Cholula sauce blends piquin peppers, arbol peppers and spices. The ingredient list on the product's packaging is: water, peppers (arbol and piquin), salt, vinegar, spices, and xanthan gum. 5 ml or 1tsp contains 0.0 calories, 0.0 g protein, 0.0 g carbohydrate, 0.0 g fat and 110 mg sodium.
